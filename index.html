<div class="hermoine">
  <p>
Hermione Granger burst into the wizarding world like a walking library 
with a wand attached. She is the kind of witch who will correct your pronunciation 
of “Wingardium Leviosa,” save your life with a spell she read about once, and then remind you there’s 
still homework due on Monday. Armed with overprepared lesson notes, an overstuffed book bag,
and a moral compass that points due “fair and just,” Hermione turns sheer brainpower, 
stubborn courage, and frizzy hair into one of the most formidable combos Hogwarts has ever seen.

  Ronald Weasley: strategic chess master, accidental hero, and part time
  collector of hand me down everything. Armed with a wonky wand, pockets full
  of crumbs, and more sarcasm than Galleons, he’s the friend who’ll
  complain the whole way into danger—and still be standing next to you when it really counts.

<p>
  Ladies and gentlemen, please keep your wands, wallets, and souls inside 
  the ride at all times – emerging from the shadows, fresh from a very intense
   nose-removal ritual, it's the Dark Lord himself! He's got seven backup copies of
   his soul, a snake for a best friend, and a résumé that's basically just 'terrorizing
 the wizarding world' in increasingly dramatic fonts. Give a… cautious welcome to Lord
  Voldemort, proof that 'too ambitious' is, in fact, a thing.

        <p>Severus Snape swept into the classroom like a thundercloud in a billowing black cape, looked down his hooked nose at the students, and sighed as if their very existence offended his timetable. With a voice soft as spilled ink and just as dangerous, he announced that today they would be brewing potions so subtle that only those with more brains than bravado had any hope of surviving his lesson with their eyebrows intact.</p>
